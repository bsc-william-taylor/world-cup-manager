## World Cup Manager

World Cup Manager was a simple world cup 2014 simulator that I built as part of a team for a module in university.

The app was written in Java and OpenGL ES with no native controls apart from the message boxes.

## Overview

This project is just a simple implementation of constructor based dependency injection in C++. It’s small and lightweight and will be taken forward and improved as time progresses. Type information is captured in lambdas and then constructed and deallocated when new instances of this type are asked for from the container.
